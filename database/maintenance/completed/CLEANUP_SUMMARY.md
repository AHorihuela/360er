# Database Cleanup Summary (June 2024)

## Overview

In June 2024, a comprehensive database cleanup was performed to remove redundant tables and views that were no longer needed. The cleanup was executed using a three-step process to ensure application stability:

1. **Rename Phase**: Tables were first renamed with a `to_remove_` prefix
2. **Testing Phase**: Application was tested thoroughly to ensure no functionality was broken
3. **Removal Phase**: After successful testing, tables were permanently removed

## Tables Removed

The following types of tables were successfully removed:

- Deprecated views (`deprecated_review_cycles_feedback_summary`, etc.)
- Policy backup tables (`policy_backup_*`, `deprecated_policy_backup_*`)
- Backup tables (`all_tables_backup_20240232`)
- Redundant analytics tables (`feedback_analyses` - functionality consolidated in `feedback_analytics`)

## Process Details

### Step 1: Rename Tables
- Script: `1_rename_before_cleanup.sql`
- Date Executed: June 2024
- Action: Added `to_remove_` prefix to potentially redundant tables
- Safety Measure: Created backup of `feedback_analyses` data

### Step 2: Testing
- Duration: Approximately one week
- Tests: All application functionality was thoroughly tested
- Result: No issues were detected with renamed tables

### Step 3: Final Cleanup
- Script: `3_final_cleanup.sql`
- Date Executed: June 2024
- Action: Permanently removed all tables with `to_remove_` prefix
- Safety Measure: Preserved `feedback_analyses_backup` table

## Verification

After cleanup, verification confirmed:
- No tables with `to_remove_` prefix remained
- No deprecated tables or views remained
- `feedback_analyses` was successfully removed
- `feedback_analyses_backup` was preserved for reference

## Notes

- The `feedback_analyses_backup` table was preserved as a safety measure
- All operations were logged in the `schema_migrations` table
- The cleanup scripts are kept in this directory for historical reference only

## Future Maintenance

For future database maintenance:

1. Review the structure of these scripts as a reference
2. Always use a multi-phase approach (rename → test → remove)
3. Create backups of any data that might be needed later
4. Log all operations in `schema_migrations`
5. Use transactions for safety
